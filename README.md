## Introduction

Saving money can be challenging, especially for Gen Z. At Frugal FrenZ, we believe that everything is better with friends. We wanted to create a mega platform that brings different ways of reaching financial goals into one place. Our goal is to make saving money less of a chore and more enjoyable by allowing users to pool money together with like-minded people, whether they are friends, family, or new connections.

With Frugal FrenZ, you can participate in a leaderboard and track your progress alongside others who have achieved their financial goals using our platform. Our customized payment plan feature allows you to choose the frequency and goal that works best for you. Additionally, you can budget and aspire to your goals, all while seeing the contributions and progress of your team.

## Features



- Customized payment plans: Choose the frequency and goal that suits your financial situation.
- Community funding: Connect with friends, family, or new acquaintances to fund a common goal and save together.
- Progress tracking: Monitor your progress and see how much you saved.
- Budgeting: Plan and manage your expenses while keeping an eye on your savings goals.
- Seamless user experience: Our website is built with cutting-edge technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.
- Planz page in Frugal FrenZ allows users to manage their group payments and track their progress. Here's an overview of the functionality provided by the payments page:
    - Users can create a group by specifying the group name, amount wanted, time duration, and first payment date.
    - Once a group is created, users can view the details of the group, including the leader's name, the number of friends in the group, and the total amount saved so far.
    - Users can view the list of payments associated with the group, including the payment amount, due date, and paid status.
    - Users can mark payments as paid, which updates the paid status and recalculates the total amount saved.
    - Users can delete a group, which removes all associated payments and updates the group information.
